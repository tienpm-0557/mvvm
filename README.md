## Features

- [x] Base classes for UIViewController, UIView, UITableViewCell and UICollectionCell
- [x] Base classes for ViewModel, ListViewModel and CellViewModel
- [x] Services injection
- [x] Custom transitioning for UINavigationController and UIViewController

## Requirements
- iOS 10.0+
- Xcode 10.0+
- Swift 5.0+

## Dependencies
The library heavily depends on [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) for data-binding and events. For who does not familiar with Reactive Programming, I suggest to start reading about it first. Beside that, here are the list of dependencies:
- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
- [Action](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/Action)
- [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire)
- [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage)
- [ObjectMapper](https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper)
- [PureLayout](https://github.com/PureLayout/PureLayout)
- [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya)

## Installation
[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate MVVM into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'MVVM'
    pod 'SwiftyJSON', '4.1.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Usage

### At the glance
The library is mainly written using Generic, so please familiar yourself with Swift Generic, and very important point, we canâ€™t use Generic UIViewController to associate with UIViewController on InterfaceBuilder or Storyboard. So programmatically is prefer, but we can still use XIBs to instantiate our view (check example for more details)

### Libray Components
##### Page, ListPage and CollectionPage
I prefer **Page** over **ViewController** in term of MVVM
* UIViewController
```swift
open class Page<VM: IViewModel>: UIViewController, IView, ITransionView 
```

```swift
///Non-generic type
open class BasePage: UIViewController, ITransitionView
```
* UITableView
```swift
open class ListPage<VM: IListViewModel>: Page<VM>
```

```swift
///Non-generic type
open class BaseListPage: BasePage, UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate
```
* UICollectionView
```swift
open class CollectionPage<VM: IListViewModel>: Page<VM>
```

```swift
///Non-generic type
open class BaseCollectionPage: BasePage
```

The idea is that each **Page** will contain a **ViewModel** property with type to be determined by generic **VM**

##### View, TableCell and CollectionCell
Same as **Page**, View is all also a generic UIView, while **TableCell** and **CollectionCell** are generic cell that can be used in **ListPage** and **CollectionPage**
```swift
open class View<VM: IGenericViewModel>: UIView, IView
```

```swift
///Non-generic type
open class BaseView: UIView, IView
```

```swift
open class CollectionCell<VM: IGenericViewModel>: UICollectionViewCell, IView
```

```swift
///Non-generic type
open class BaseCollectionCell: UICollectionViewCell, IView
```

```swift
open class TableCell<VM: IGenericViewModel>: UITableViewCell, IView
```

```swift
///Non-generic type
open class BaseTableCell: UITableViewCell, IView
```

They all have generic type **VM** to determine its own ViewModel

By inheriting **View** or **Page**, and implementing 2 main methods:
```swift
open func initialize() {}

open func bindViewAndViewModel() {}
```
Then we have a full set of a view that can bind with ViewModel

##### ViewModel, ListViewModel and CellViewModel
Base classes for our ViewModel
```swift
open class ViewModel<M: Model>: NSObject, IViewModel
```
```swift
open class ListViewModel<M: Model, CVM: IGenericViewModel>: ViewModel<M>, IListViewModel
```
```swift
open class CellViewModel<M: Model>: NSObject, IGenericViewModel
```
As we can see, **ViewModel** and **CellViewModel** use one generic type **M** (which is based type is Model). This generic type is for us to determine the model type for each ViewModel. The difference between **ViewModel** and **CellViewModel** is **ViewModel** contains navigation service that can help use to navigate between our pages in apllication, while **CellViewModel** does not.
**ListViewModel** is a bit different. It uses one more generic type **CVM**, which represented for ViewModel type of a cell in side a page. In the other hand, it contains an items source array that can be bind with a list page or collection page

Please check examples for details usages of these base classes.

##### Services
The library also supports services injection (for Unit Test) and some built-in services, especially navigation service, that helps us to navigate between our pages. Navigation service, by default, is injected to Page and ViewModel
By calling
```swift
DependencyManager.shared.registerDefaults()
```
to register for all built-in services (NavigationService, StorageService and AlertService) in the library
Or you can create your own navigation service and override the default injection. See examples for detail steps to setup services injection.

##### Page Transitions
The library also supports for page transitions, including pages inside a navigation page and pages that presents modally. See examples for how to implement page transitions
